# Summary:
#
#      This script post-process the SMAP-HydroBlocks dataset from the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) space
#      into the geographically gridded space. The final domain extent, temporal coverage, and temporal resolution
#      are user-defined parameters. The data uses a Plate CarrÃ©e projection and can be output as Zarr storage
#      (recommended) or NetCDF files. Both can be open with python libraries such as xarrays. Please see the 
#      README.md for library instalation and usaga notes.

# Load libraries needed
import os
import datetime
import SMAPHB_functions as SMAPHB_functions

# 1. Define workspace folder
workspace = os.getcwd() # current folder

# Database path
database_path = '%s/database' % workspace
variable = 'SMAPHB_SM'

# 2. Output folder name
output_folder = '%s/SMAPHB_sample' % workspace

# 3. Output file format. Options: 'zarr', 'netcdf', or 'both'
# Netcdf is only recommended for small subsets of the data. Alternatively, please use zarr. Both netcdf and zarr files can be open with xarrays.
output_data_format = 'netcdf'

# 4. Set the domain of interest in geographic coordinates
minlat = 37.0
maxlat = 37.5
minlon = -91.7
maxlon = -91.2

# 5. Set the output time period of interest. It must be between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2019 (SMAP-HB retrieval dates)
start_date = datetime.date(2016,1,1)
end_date = datetime.date(2016,12,31)

# 6. Set the output time resolution of interest. Original retrievals are at '6h' temporal resolution, but data can also be output at 'daily', 'monthly', 'annual' temporal resolution.
final_temporal_resolution = 'daily' 

# 7. Set the output spatial resolution. This is an experimental feature that regrids data to spatial resolutions > 30 meters. This uses xESMF, but only works without MPI support (mpi_run = False)
final_spatial_resolution = 30   # meters

# 8. Set the output data compression level [0-9]. More compression saves storage but will slow down data procressing.
compression_level = 5

# The remapping can be performed in parallel with mpi_run = True and:
# 'mpirun -np <number of processes> python SMAPHB_hru2grid.py'
# In the future, it would be nice to have dask parallelization instead.
mpi_run = False

# Retrive data
